# HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It is the backbone of web pages and provides the structure for displaying content such as text, images, links, forms, and multimedia.

HTML documents consist of a series of elements, each enclosed in opening and closing tags, which define the structure and content of the page. These elements describe the purpose and formatting of the content they contain. For example, the `<p>` element is used to define a paragraph, while the `<img>` element is used to insert an image.

Here's a basic example of HTML code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Sample Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>
    <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image">
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML being used.
- `<html>`: The root element of the HTML document, which contains all other elements.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, such as its title and links to stylesheets or scripts.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the document, displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the document.
- `<h1>`: Defines a top-level heading.
- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph.
- `<img>`: Inserts an image, with the `src` attribute specifying the image file's location and the `alt` attribute providing alternative text for accessibility.
- `<a>`: Defines a hyperlink, with the `href` attribute specifying the destination URL.

HTML is often combined with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to enhance the appearance and functionality of web pages. CSS is used for styling and layout, while JavaScript is used for dynamic behavior and interactivity. Together, these technologies form the basis of modern web development.
