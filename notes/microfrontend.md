# Micro Frontend Application
A Micro Frontend architecture is an approach to developing web applications by breaking down the user interface into smaller, independently deployable parts, often referred to as micro frontends. Each micro frontend represents a self-contained feature or module of the application's user interface.

In a Micro Frontend application:

1. **Decomposition**: The application's user interface is decomposed into smaller, more manageable parts, each owned by a different team or development group. These parts are often aligned with business capabilities or domain boundaries.

2. **Independent Development**: Each micro frontend is developed, tested, and deployed independently of the other parts of the application. This allows teams to work autonomously and release updates to their specific features without impacting other parts of the application.

3. **Technology Diversity**: Different micro frontends within the same application can be built using different technologies, frameworks, or programming languages. This flexibility enables teams to choose the tools and technologies that best suit their needs and expertise.

4. **Integration**: Micro frontends are integrated into the application's shell or container at runtime, typically using client-side routing or lazy loading techniques. This integration can be achieved using JavaScript frameworks, custom scripts, or web components.

5. **Isolation**: Micro frontends are isolated from each other, both at the code level and at runtime. This isolation helps prevent conflicts between different parts of the application and allows teams to make changes to their micro frontend without affecting other parts of the application.

6. **Scalability and Maintainability**: Micro Frontend architecture allows for better scalability and maintainability of large and complex web applications. It enables teams to work on smaller, more manageable codebases, reduces the risk of codebase coupling, and improves overall development velocity.

Micro Frontend architecture is particularly useful for large-scale web applications with multiple teams, complex user interfaces, and evolving requirements. It promotes modularity, reusability, and collaboration among development teams, while also enabling faster iteration and delivery of new features to end-users.

## MicroFrontend Application Example
Let's consider an example of a simple e-commerce application built using Micro Frontend architecture. In this example, we'll decompose the application into three micro frontends: Product Catalog, Shopping Cart, and Checkout.

1. **Product Catalog Micro Frontend**:
   - This micro frontend is responsible for displaying a list of products available for purchase.
   - It includes features such as browsing products, viewing product details, and adding products to the shopping cart.
   - Technologies used: React.js with TypeScript.

2. **Shopping Cart Micro Frontend**:
   - This micro frontend manages the user's shopping cart, allowing them to view and modify the items in their cart.
   - It includes features such as adding items to the cart, removing items, and updating quantities.
   - Technologies used: Vue.js with Vuex for state management.

3. **Checkout Micro Frontend**:
   - This micro frontend handles the checkout process, allowing users to review their order, enter shipping and payment information, and place the order.
   - It includes features such as entering shipping details, selecting payment methods, and confirming the order.
   - Technologies used: Angular with RxJS for handling asynchronous operations.

Each micro frontend is developed, tested, and deployed independently by different teams. They are integrated into the main application shell using client-side routing or lazy loading techniques.

Here's a simplified directory structure of the Micro Frontend application:

```
micro-frontends-example/
│
├── product-catalog/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── App.tsx
│   └── package.json
│
├── shopping-cart/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── store/
│   │   ├── views/
│   │   └── App.vue
│   └── package.json
│
├── checkout/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   ├── containers/
│   │   └── app.component.ts
│   └── package.json
│
└── main-app/
    ├── public/
    │   ├── index.html
    │   └── ...
    ├── src/
    │   ├── components/
    │   ├── services/
    │   ├── App.js
    │   └── index.js
    └── package.json
```

In this structure:

- Each micro frontend (Product Catalog, Shopping Cart, Checkout) has its own directory containing source code files and a `package.json` file.
- The main application (main-app) serves as the application shell and integrates the micro frontends. It includes a directory for static assets (`public`), source code files, and a `package.json` file.

The integration of micro frontends into the main application shell can be achieved using various techniques, such as client-side routing, custom JavaScript code, or web components. Each micro frontend can be deployed independently and integrated into the main application at runtime, enabling teams to work autonomously and release updates to their specific features without impacting other parts of the application.

## Simple MicroFrontEnd Application Step by Step
Sure, let's create a simple Micro Frontend application step by step. In this example, we'll create three micro frontends: Product Catalog, Shopping Cart, and Checkout. We'll also have a main application shell to integrate these micro frontends.

Step 1: Set up the project directory
Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it using your terminal or command prompt.

```
mkdir microfrontend-example
cd microfrontend-example
```

Step 2: Initialize each micro frontend
Inside the project directory, create three directories for each micro frontend: product-catalog, shopping-cart, and checkout.

```
mkdir product-catalog shopping-cart checkout
```

Step 3: Initialize each micro frontend as a separate Node.js project
Navigate into each micro frontend directory and initialize it as a Node.js project.

```
cd product-catalog
npm init -y

cd ../shopping-cart
npm init -y

cd ../checkout
npm init -y
```

Step 4: Install necessary dependencies for each micro frontend
In each micro frontend directory, install necessary dependencies. For this example, let's use React for Product Catalog, Vue.js for Shopping Cart, and Angular for Checkout.

```
cd product-catalog
npm install react react-dom

cd ../shopping-cart
npm install vue@next vuex@next

cd ../checkout
npm install @angular/core @angular/common @angular/forms @angular/platform-browser @angular/platform-browser-dynamic
```

Step 5: Create the main application shell
Back in the project directory, create a directory for the main application shell.

```
mkdir main-app
```

Step 6: Initialize the main application shell as a Node.js project
Navigate into the main-app directory and initialize it as a Node.js project.

```
cd main-app
npm init -y
```

Step 7: Install necessary dependencies for the main application shell
In the main-app directory, install necessary dependencies. We'll use Express.js as the server and Axios for making HTTP requests.

```
npm install express axios
```

Step 8: Set up the directory structure
Inside the main-app directory, create a public directory for static assets and a src directory for source code files.

```
mkdir public src
```

Step 9: Create the main application entry file
Inside the src directory of the main application, create an index.js file.

```
touch src/index.js
```

Step 10: Create the main application HTML file
Inside the public directory of the main application, create an index.html file.

```
touch public/index.html
```

Step 11: Create micro frontend entry files
Inside each micro frontend directory (product-catalog, shopping-cart, checkout), create an entry file (e.g., index.js) that serves as the entry point for the micro frontend.

```
cd product-catalog
touch index.js

cd ../shopping-cart
touch index.js

cd ../checkout
touch index.js
```

Step 12: Build each micro frontend
In each micro frontend directory, write the code to build the micro frontend. You can use the respective framework/library (React, Vue.js, Angular) to build each micro frontend.

Step 13: Integrate micro frontends into the main application shell
In the main application entry file (src/index.js), set up routing or lazy loading to integrate the micro frontends into the main application shell.

Step 14: Start the server
In the main-app directory, create an app.js file and set up an Express.js server to serve the main application shell.

Step 15: Test the application
Run the server and navigate to the localhost address in your browser to test the application. Ensure that each micro frontend is correctly integrated into the main application shell and that the application behaves as expected.

That's it! You've created a simple Micro Frontend application with three micro frontends (Product Catalog, Shopping Cart, Checkout) integrated into a main application shell. You can further extend the application by adding more micro frontends or additional features to existing micro frontends.
