## Document Object Model
DOM stands for Document Object Model. In HTML programming, the Document Object Model is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree-like model, where each node represents a part of the document, such as elements, attributes, and text.

The DOM provides a way for programs to dynamically access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of HTML documents. This means that JavaScript, for example, can be used to modify the content of a webpage, change styles, respond to user interactions, and more.

The DOM is platform and language-neutral, meaning it is not tied to any specific programming language or operating system. It is implemented by web browsers to provide a structured representation of web documents, allowing them to be manipulated programmatically.
